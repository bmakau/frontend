# Basketball Team Management System
***
The system would manage the basic data associated with a basketball team(General Managers, Coaches, Players) and allow each entity to be 
viewed and modified accordingly. Users can login as a General Manager, a Coach, or a Player. A General Manager would be able to trade/cut/sign players,
fire/hire coaches, get team/player stats, and change the team name or location. A Coach would be able to modify players’ minutes and position 
as well as create a lineup of 5 players that would be utilized in a game.
A player may modify their name, height, and weight to reflect any changes in their physique, request trades, and get their personal stats.

### Team Members: Darius Johnson, Boniface Makau, Jad Al Wazzan, Chris Wolfe-McGuire
